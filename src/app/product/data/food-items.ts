It is often said that cuisine is culture, and to understand the development of Mexican cuisine it is important to know about the history of Mexico. In the pre-Colombian time corn was greatly used to make tortillas, tamales, or also made into flour. The diet of corn was placed with meats, vegetables, and many flavorful spices. However the country's cuisine changed dramatically with influences brought by the Spanish. They brought rice, olives, wines, spices from India, and beef along with many others",
